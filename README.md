# MedicalAdministration *in developpment*
A desktop application for medical administration. This appplication is to be used by medical clinics in order to store their clients in a database and set doctor appointments. It will also allow for the doctor to store information on the appointment such as medical notes or perscriptions given. On a later stage this application will also allow to automatically create the receipts for customer payment.

This app is written partially in Portuguese since it's being developped for a Poruguese company.
